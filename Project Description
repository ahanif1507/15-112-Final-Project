Project Description: Soccer Heads
For the final project, I am planning to develop a game. The game is Soccer Heads.
It is a soccer game with just two players who have big heads and just one foot.
The players can jump, kick and move forward and backwards.
The game will run for one minute and the player with the most goals in that time wins.
The game will have two modes: a 1vs1 and against the AI

The libraries that will be used to make the game include but are not limited to:
Pygame
Math
Random
AI (easyAI or anyother library which suits the game)

By November 25 (first milestone) I intend to make the simple 1vs1 mode for the game

By December 6 (second milestone) I will finish implementing the AI mode of the game and 
add some extra features such as in game speed boosters, change in player size, change of goal size, 
addition of sound effects.
